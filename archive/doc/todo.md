## TODO LIST

### The bundle file for the dapp is verified on the hash chain before loading
* dapp management can be loaded online and cached locally.
* Hash verification for loaded bundle files
* The RN app needs to load the wallet and spv node SDKs, which can be chained

### How does dapp verify the RN app running it, and is it authorized? (The plan is uncertain, to be discussed)
* When the RN app is built, it will be hashed and then stored in the chain to ensure that the hash of the same code build is consistent.
* dapp will verify the current hash at runtime

### Carrier Integration
* Carrier RN plugin development

### RT Integration (to be discussed)
